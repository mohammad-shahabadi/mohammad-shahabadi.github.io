#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Hi! I am Mohammad Shahabadi, a final-year B.Sc. Computer Engineering student at K. N. Toosi University of Technology, with a GPA of 3.73. I have a strong foundation in software engineering and programming languages, developed through over two years of experience working as a Software Engineer at Digikala, the biggest e-commerce in Iran and Utechia, where I contributed to high-traffic applications and backend systems.

As a Research Intern at the NUS, I collaborated with Professor Henz on the SourceAcademy project to enhance a C compiler with WebAssembly for client-side execution, which sparked my interest in language implementation and compilers. This exposure to web-based computation has inspired me to explore the intersection of software engineering with programming language design.

Through these experiences, I’ve gained practical skills in developing software solutions and deepened my interest in compiler design, web-based computation, and frameworks that enhance usability for scientific applications. I am now eager to further my studies in these areas and contribute to advancing software systems.
